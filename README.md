# SentinelSIEM

A proof-of-concept Security Information & Event Management platform built in Go, backed by Elasticsearch. Designed as the central detection and investigation brain for the Sentinel security portfolio.

## Why SentinelSIEM?

Most SIEM platforms are either expensive commercial products with opaque internals, or open-source projects that require stitching together a dozen loosely coupled tools. SentinelSIEM takes a different approach:

- **Single-binary simplicity.** Each component is a standalone Go binary — no JVM, no Python runtime, no container orchestration required. Build it, copy it, run it.
- **Native Sigma support.** Detection rules use [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma), the open standard used by thousands of detection engineers worldwide. Ship with 3000+ community rules on day one. No proprietary rule language to learn.
- **ECS-first normalization.** Every event from every source is normalized to the [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html) before it hits storage. Cross-source correlation works because the data model is consistent, not because you wrote custom joins.
- **Cross-portfolio correlation.** SentinelSIEM natively correlates across EDR, AV, DLP, Windows, and syslog sources. A malware detection on one host plus a DLP policy violation on the same user within 15 minutes? That's one alert, not two tickets in two consoles.
- **Built-in case management.** Alert escalation, observable tracking, analyst collaboration, and resolution metrics without an external tool like TheHive or ServiceNow.
- **Transparent and hackable.** The entire codebase is readable Go with minimal dependencies. If you want to add a parser, write a struct that implements one interface. If you want to add a detection, write a YAML file.

SentinelSIEM is designed for security teams that want to understand their tooling, not just operate it.

## What It Does

SentinelSIEM ingests telemetry from multiple security sources, normalizes events to ECS, evaluates Sigma detection rules in real time, and provides a query interface for threat hunting — all through a React-based dashboard with built-in case management.

### Data Sources

| Source | Protocol | Status | Description |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| sentinel_edr | JSON/HTTP | Implemented | Endpoint behavior telemetry (process, network, registry, file events) |
| Sentinel AV | JSON/HTTP | Implemented | Malware scan results, quarantine actions, real-time blocks |
| Sentinel DLP | JSON/HTTP | Implemented | Data classification, policy violations, removable media events |
| Windows Event Logs | WEF/HTTP | Implemented | Security, Sysmon, and system events via XML or Winlogbeat JSON |
| Syslog | TCP/UDP/TLS | Implemented | Firewalls, Linux auditd, network devices (RFC 5424 & 3164) |

### Ingestion Pipeline

- **HTTP endpoint** (`/api/v1/ingest`) — NDJSON and JSON array batch support, API key authentication, per-IP rate limiting
- **WEF endpoint** (`/api/v1/ingest/wef`) — Windows Event Forwarding with auto-detection of XML vs JSON payloads, BOM handling, batch XML splitting
- **Syslog listener** — TCP (newline-delimited + octet-counting framing), UDP, and TLS on configurable ports with connection limits and idle timeouts
- **Normalization engine** — Per-source-type parsers registered at startup, routing by `source_type` field. Extensible via the `normalize.Parser` interface
- **Syslog sub-parsers** — YAML-driven regex configs for structured field extraction (ships with iptables, auditd, generic KV). Regexes pre-compiled at startup using Go's RE2 engine (linear-time, no ReDoS)

### Detection Engine

- **Sigma rules** — Native parsing and evaluation of the open-standard YAML detection format
- **Single-event rules** — Field matching with full modifier support (`contains`, `re`, `cidr`, `base64`, `all`, etc.)
- **Correlation rules** — Multi-event patterns: `event_count` (threshold), `value_count` (distinct values), `temporal` (ordered sequences within time windows)
- **Cross-portfolio detections** — Rules that correlate across EDR + AV + DLP sources to detect multi-stage attack chains
- **Hot-reload** — File watcher + CLI trigger for zero-downtime rule updates

### Case Management

Built-in incident response workflow: alert escalation, observable extraction (IPs, hashes, domains, usernames), analyst collaboration via timeline, MITRE ATT&CK tagging, and resolution tracking with detection efficacy metrics (MTTD/MTTR).
