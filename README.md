# SentinelSIEM

A proof-of-concept Security Information & Event Management platform built in Go, backed by Elasticsearch. Designed as the central detection and investigation brain for the Sentinel security portfolio.

## What It Does

SentinelSIEM ingests telemetry from multiple security sources, normalizes events to the Elastic Common Schema (ECS), evaluates Sigma detection rules in real time, and provides a query interface for threat hunting — all through a React-based dashboard with built-in case management.

### Data Sources

| Source | Protocol | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| SentinelEDR | JSON/HTTP | Endpoint behavior telemetry (process, network, registry, file events) |
| Sentinel AV | JSON/HTTP | Malware scan results, quarantine actions, real-time blocks |
| Sentinel DLP | JSON/HTTP | Data classification, policy violations, removable media events |
| Windows Event Logs | WEF/HTTP | Security, Sysmon, and system events via XML or Winlogbeat JSON |
| Syslog | TCP/UDP/TLS | Firewalls, Linux auditd, network devices (RFC 5424 & 3164) |

### Detection Engine

- **Sigma rules** — Native parsing and evaluation of the open-standard YAML detection format
- **Single-event rules** — Field matching with full modifier support (`contains`, `re`, `cidr`, `base64`, `all`, etc.)
- **Correlation rules** — Multi-event patterns: `event_count` (threshold), `value_count` (distinct values), `temporal` (ordered sequences within time windows)
- **Cross-portfolio detections** — Rules that correlate across EDR + AV + DLP sources to detect multi-stage attack chains
- **Hot-reload** — File watcher + CLI trigger for zero-downtime rule updates

### Case Management

Built-in incident response workflow: alert escalation, observable extraction (IPs, hashes, domains, usernames), analyst collaboration via timeline, MITRE ATT&CK tagging, and resolution tracking with detection efficacy metrics (MTTD/MTTR).

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sentinel-ingest` | HTTP/syslog listener, API key auth, NDJSON batch support |
| `sentinel-normalize` | ECS normalization engine with per-source-type parsers |
| `sentinel-store` | Elasticsearch client — index templates, ILM, bulk indexing |
| `sentinel-correlate` | Real-time Sigma rule engine with correlation state management |
| `sentinel-query` | REST API server, query language → ES DSL translation, serves dashboard |
| `sentinel-cli` | Management CLI for rules, sources, keys, health, and ad-hoc queries |
| `sentinel-dashboard` | React SPA — alert triage, cases, threat hunting, rule management, source health |
